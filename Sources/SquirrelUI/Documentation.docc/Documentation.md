# ``SquirrelUI``


## Overview

This library offers modern asynchronous image loading and displaying functionality 
with an optimized cache for Apple platforms.

``SquirrelUI`` offers an ``AsyncCachedImage`` view for loading and displaying images. 
Designed in the same spirit as [`AsyncImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AsyncImage), 
it uses `AsyncImageCachingLoader` from `Squirrel` for loading images, allowing to enjoy all of its features.
